## IOS Application for classifying garbage

This is my first attempt at a Machine Learning project

Built from the TensorFlow IOS Demo

https://github.com/tensorflow/examples/tree/master/lite/examples/image_classification/ios

Retrained mobilenets_v2 model with dataset from 

https://www.kaggle.com/asdasdasasdas/garbage-classification

and converted to a TFLite Model for IOS

Currently accuracy is low and as such next iteration will use the http://tacodataset.org 

(and hopefully i will be better at this)
